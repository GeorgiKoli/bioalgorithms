# Organization

The codebase is divided in 3 libraries in hierarchical order:

* bioalgorithms - library implementing complete bioinformatics algorithms such as Motif Finding, Genome Assembling, etc. (uses **biostructures** and **salib**). 

* biostructures - library abstracting biochemical structures and operations (uses **salib**) 

* salib - library implementing software algorithms
